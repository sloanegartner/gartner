          <h5 class="card-subtitle">User Interaction Design Project // 2019-2020</h5>
          <p class="card-text">SHERPA is a financial app that I designed for my User Experience class in the School of Media Arts and Design. While in the class, I studied web and mobile interactions and design principles including usability, interactive design strategy, wireframing, and web and mobile app prototype development. I used Adobe XD to create the wireframe as well as the low and high fidelity parts of the project. I then used Adobe InDesign for creating the graphics and putting together the final report of the app. SHERPA is designed to make money management and tracking easier. With so many different ways to pay; Apple Pay, Venmo, PayPal, Uber, etc, it is hard for people to keep track of electronic payments and cash payments. SHERPA links all forms of electronic payments into one easy to use interface. Much like how a Sherpa is experienced in helping travelers prepare and achieve their goal of reaching high summits, SHERPA, the app, helps those who are unskilled or uncomfortable with money management reach a goal of confidence and understanding with their money. Through this project, I learned the process of user interaction and protoyping for a user friendly interface.</p>

          <h5 class="card-subtitle">Web and Graphic Design Project // 2020</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The client wanted a site displaying his music and offering music lessons. I designed the logo as well as worked with Squarespace's features on the design and layout of the webiste. Through the process I learned about Squarespace and how to work with a client to ensure that the site meets all the needs. Since my client is a pianist, I wanted the site to have a "Rhapsody in Blue" theme to it. I had the site's color scheme be blue, purple, and gray, and the logo resemeble a retro 1960's blues typography with a note sheet behind his initials. This was a different project for me becasue I wasn't assinged it, there was no rubric to check if I did everything right. I enjoyed the creative freedom and learning about how to use Squarespace.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Honey, I'm Home was a logo I created for businesses that produce their own honey. This was a project that was meant to teach me the features of Adobe Creative Cloud, and then use the tools to create a marketing campaign. The class focused on tools and techniques that are used to create graphic content for diverse media delivery systems. The design of the logo is suppose to be blug like in form, with bee stripes on the back, and honey comb wheels. They Slogan "Honey, I'm Home" refers to the home grown home that can be delivered to customers. I enjoyed this project because I interesting learning how to use Adobe Illistrator, along with the other Adobe features, to create something fun.</p>

          <p class="card-text">For the Summer of 2019, I studied abroad in Ireland. While in Galway, we partnered with For√≥ige, a nonprofit youth development organization to create a website on food waste. As part of the web team, I was to examine the social and cultural context of Galway and create a user friendly site that effectivly and accurately displayed the information gathered. Using Wordpress, I was able to create a five page web site as well as work on the design and layout to make the site interactive. The project not only tought me the inner workings of Wordpress, it also tought me about child themes, user experience, and being able to make an effective product in a short amount of time.</p>

          <p class="card-text">This project was for my introduction to web design class in the School of Media Arts and Design. My task was to choose a website and redesign it as I saw fit. I chose the websites that gave information on the Breweries and Wineries in the Harrisonburg and Rockingham County area. Instead of choosing one website, I decided to choose multiple sites and make "The AleHouse", a one stop shop for users to find all the information they need on the topic of drinks. Besides the wood background and drink labels, the images are my own as well as the design layout. Through this project I learned about Boostrap and the grid structure as well as Boostraps other features, such as drop down menus, Jumbotron, contact form, and buttons. </p>
