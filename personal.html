    <h5>Spline</h5>
  <h4>3D Design Tool // Interactive</h4>
    <p>I am currently working on expanding and improving my portfolio. Along with updating my past projects, I am also adding new projects that display new skills. I've begun working on improving my skills with Spline, the 3D design tool. By using Spline, I created an interactive 3D toggle. Check it out!</p>

<!-- SHERPA -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <h5>SHERPA</h5>
  <h4>Web Design // Visual Layout // Organizing & Creating Content</h4>
    <p>SHERPA is a financial app that I designed for my B.A. in Interactive Design. I studied web and mobile interactions and design principles including usability, interactive design strategy, wire-framing, and web and mobile app prototype development. For this app, I conducted interviews, user and usability testing, and designed wireframes and prototypes. I created the SHERPA app in Figma. SHERPA is designed to help with money management. The app keep tracks of daily, weekly, and monthly payments. You can customize which topics of spending the app displays. The user can also add their cards to the app to track how much they spend on each card. This project is currently being worked on.</p>

<!-- BarMe -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <h5>BarMe</h5>
  <h4>SEO // Long Tail Keywords // Content Management</h4>
    <p>barMe is a mobile user interface that I am currently working on. The app is for those new to the scene, just turned 21, or you just want to find an amazing bar with great drinks and deals. barMe is your guide. Designed for young adults, the app allows for users to quickly find bars in their area as well as check wait times, invite friends, find drink specials, deals, reviews, and any events happening. The app is constantly updated, having the user effectivly check how packed the bar is minutes before arriving. barMe also grows and adapts with the more user interaction. The user is able to rate the bar they decide to visit. This rating is then averaged with other young adults in the area, creating a reliable rating. Never will you have to wait in the cold, be unsure about a drink, or walk into a bar blind, with barMe you will be prepared to have a good time. Drink responsibly and use barMe. The content and designs of the app were created through user research, feedback methodologies, wireframes, and prototypes.</p>

    <h5>The AleHouse</h5>
  <h4>Bootstrap // JavaScript // Web Developer // Website Content Planning</h4>
    <p>This is a personal project I completed to learn about Bootstrap and JavaScript. The website is of a brewery company that displays the beer, wine, and events. I designd the logo in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and the photography is my own. Within this project, I display skills in Bootstrap, JavaScript, and implementing interactive feature such as using carousels and jarallax. The site is also responsive, the web page adjusts and changes to the devices or screen size it is being viewed on.</p>
