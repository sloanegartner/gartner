        <p>I am currently working as a Product Researcher for US News and World Report. I work within the 360 Reviews Team and research products for monthly ratings. I aggregate data, preform SEO keyword analysis and analyze raw data to make conclusions about the certain product. I’ve also been freelancing as a web designer and photographer for 3 years. I’ve worked with clients on their professional sites, logos, and overall design and layout of their website and web pages. Recently, I have begun work on making a client’s website SEO-friendly. I have been working to improve the user experience across their entire site. This is similar to my work with Foróige, a leading youth organization in Ireland. I partici- pated in a Media, Culture, and Society study abroad where I designed a WordPress site that presented the issues of food waste in Galway. I was in charge of the design of the site as well as the positioning of content and posting information to social media.

          I have experience with user-centered design, front-end web development, video production, photography, and visual design. I am intermediate and advanced in Adobe Creative Cloud, specifically working in Adobe Lightroom, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and XD. From freelancing, I've learned how to be self driven and work with real clients. However, I am excited to learn more about the field of interactive design through working in a more corprate setting and alongside creative individuals.

      	<p class="card-text">Recently, I graduated from James Madison University with a B.A. in Interactive Design and Psychology. While an Interactive Design major in the <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/" target="_blank">School of Media Arts and Design (SMAD),</a> I study the importance of digital convergence and user experience. Within my classes, I designed and created content through web code and developed my skills in user experience design and web content management. Combining my Interactive Design major with my Psychology major, I would like to fullfill user's needs and create appealing human to device interactions.

      	When I wasn't in class or on the field, I worked as Lead Photographer at James Madison's <a href="https://info.jmu.edu/tad/" target="_blank">Technology and Design (TAD)</a>. TAD serves to complete creative projects for the departments of JMU's University Unions. I took photos of events around campus, concerts, student run events, ceremonies, etc. I worked with real-world clients and with deadlines that needed to be met. Working at TAD has been one of my greatest experiences at Madison because it has given me the hands-on experience with project management that I need in order to be prepared for employment. I feel that the experiences I've had, have taught me to be a hard-worker, problem-solver, and dependable individual.</p>
