		<p>I am currently working as a Research Analyst for US News & World Report’s 360 Reviews team. I’ve been assisting with user research to better predict what products and services the user will more likely review and then purchase. With the research found, we analyze the data a create a "Best List". Once published, I maintain and work with out editorial team to continuously update the content. Currently my team is in the process of creating a Mattress Recommendation tool, a survey, to gain more insight into what our users and readers are looking for when purchasing a mattress.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve also been freelancing as a web designer and photographer for 4 years. I’ve worked with clients on their professional sites, logos, and overall design and layout of their website and web pages. Recently, I worked on a client’s metadata, keywords, and meta-descriptions to make the website more SEO-friendly. This is similar to my work with Foróige, a leading youth organization in Ireland. I participated in a Media, Culture, and Society study abroad where I designed a website that presented the issues of food waste in Galway, Ireland. I was in charge of the design of the site as well as the positioning of content and posting information to social media.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’ve also worked as Lead Photographer for James Madison University’s media shop, <a href="https://info.jmu.edu/tad/" target="_blank">Technology and Design (TAD)</a>. I worked at TAD for 4 years. This gave me practical experience in professional areas, such as project management, digital media production, content strategy, and consulting. As Lead Photographer, I contacted clients, prepared photo shoots, edited, and sent off finished products in a timely manner. I also worked on projects with the graphic design, web, and video teams.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated from James Madison University with a B.A. in Interactive Design and Psychology. While an Interactive Design major in the <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/" target="_blank">School of Media Arts and Design (SMAD),</a>I studied the importance of digital convergence and user experience. Within my classes, I designed and created content through web code and developed my skills in user experience design and web content management. Combining my Interactive Design major with my Psychology major, I would like to fulfill user's needs and create appealing human to device interactions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated from James Madison University with a B.A. in InterI am qualified in consulting directly with clients, brand development, and I am skilled in Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML, CSS, Figma, and Axure. I also have experience with the user-centered design process and creating wireframes and prototypes.</p>
