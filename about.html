		<p>I have experience with user-centered design, front-end web development, video production, photography, and visual design. I am intermediate and advanced in Adobe Creative Cloud, specifically working in Adobe Lightroom, InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and XD. From freelancing as a web designer, I've learned how to be self-driven and work with real clients. This experience has led me to want to peruse a career in UX/UI. With my experience in consulting directly with clients, brand development, Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML, CSS, Figma, and Axure. I feel that I have a strong foundation in UX/UI. From freelancing I gained real-world experience in the user-centered design process and creating wireframes and prototypes. I would love the opportunity to showcase my skills in interactive design as well as learn and build new ones.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Recently, I graduated from James Madison University with a B.A. in Interactive Design and Psychology. While an Interactive Design major in the <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/" target="_blank">School of Media Arts and Design (SMAD),</a>I studied the importance of digital convergence and user experience. Within my classes, I designed and created content through web code and developed my skills in user experience design and web content management. Combining my Interactive Design major with my Psychology major, I would like to fulfill user's needs and create appealing human to device interactions.</p>
		<br>
		<p>When I wasn't in class or on the field hockey field, I worked as Lead Photographer at James Madison's <a href="https://info.jmu.edu/tad/" target="_blank">Technology and Design (TAD)</a>. TAD serves to complete creative projects for the departments of JMU's University Unions. I took photos of events around campus, concerts, student run events, ceremonies, etc. I worked with real-world clients and with deadlines that needed to be met. Working at TAD has been one of my greatest experiences at Madison because it has given me the hands-on experience with project management and consulting that I needed in order to be prepared for employment. I feel that the experiences I've had, have taught me to be a hard-worker, problem-solver, and dependable individual.</p>
