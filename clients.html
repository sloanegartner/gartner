    <h5>Call Me From the Grave</h5>
    <h4>Web Design // Visual Layout // Organizing & Creating Content</h4>
    <p>I designed a website for a client's musical. I planned, created, and coded my clients website and web pages using Squarespace. I combined text with sounds, pictures, graphics and video clips. I was responsible for creating the design and layout of the website and web pages. I currently manage the site and add relevant content when needed or requested. This is a paid position.</p>

    <h4>SEO // Long Tail Keywords // Content Management</h4>
    <p>I am currently working with a client on their promotional website. I am responsible for redesigning the entire website to increase website traffic. I have been creating keyword analysis, mood boards, website mock-ups, and researching ways to improve SEO rankings. I am working with Squarespace on designing a more user-friendly and SEO-friendly website. This is a paid position.</p>

    <h5>Music Lyrics Soul</h5>
    <h4>Visual Branding // Content Management // System Communication</h4>
    <p>The client decided on a site displaying his music and offering music lessons. I designed the logo as well as worked with Squarespace's features on the design and layout of the website. Through the process I learned about Squarespace and how to work with a client to ensure that the site meets all the needs. Since my client is a pianist, I wanted the site to have a "Rhapsody in Blue" theme to it. I had the site's color scheme be blue, purple, and gray, and the logo resemble a retro 1960's blues typography with a note sheet behind his initials. This was a different project for me because I wasn't assigned it, there was no rubric to check if I did everything right. I enjoyed the creative freedom and learning about how to use Squarespace. I currently manage the site and add relevant content when needed or requested. This is a paid position.</p>

    <h5>Beatha Galway: Food Waste</h5>
    <h4>Media Production // Content Production // Web Developer // Website Content Planning</h4>
    <p>For the Summer of 2019, I studied abroad in Ireland. While in Galway, we partnered with Foroige, a nonprofit youth development organization to create a website on food waste. As part of the web team, I was to examine the social and cultural context of Galway and create a user friendly site that effectively and accurately displayed the information gathered. Using Wordpress, I was able to create a five page web site as well as work on the design and layout to make the site interactive. The project not only taught me the inner workings of Wordpress, it also taught me about child themes, user experience, and being able to make an effective product in a short amount of time.</p>
